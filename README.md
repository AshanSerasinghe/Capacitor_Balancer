## Capacitor Balancer Tool

The resultant capacitance of corresponding arms of Y-connected two capitor banks should be equal to have a zero voltage diffrence at star point.

At the installation all the capacitors have the same value, hence the above critaria is automatically satisfied. But when the time pass the capacitor values of capacitors changes. The change is random and that cause to unbalance the capacitor bank. When such unbalance occured the capacitors the bank shoud be shuffled so that the resulting arrangement meet the forementioned criteria. 

When this sinario occured in a grid substation, either the capacitors are randomly shuffled or the officer in-charged do a hard calculation to find best arrangemnet. The capacitor banks in grid substations are big in size and capacitors are heavy, so the random shuffling is not practical. And the calculation is also not resulting to the best solution sice the calculation need somany iterations. 

This software was developed to do that hand calculation effecently and give best arrangement. Still the tool does not give the optimum arrangement. That part still in the development.
